# Casting a Phoenix Down on a 2009 Macbook Pro

![SidexSide](https://github.com/esteban-flores/MacbookPro/assets/60724828/9291d1d9-99e6-4795-b689-af27d30087f6)

From a young age, I was able to get my hands on no longer used tech. My older brothers would build custom PCs so instead of them throwing out the parts, I would ask them to give them to me. I would use some parts to upgrade my pc but others I would use to make other builds.

This project is all thanks to my older sister. She believes in me as the resident IT family member. I visited my sister recently and saw an old MacBook Pro collecting dust. I asked her if it could still power on. She said it didn’t work and if I could get it to work, I could have it. It had been sitting for a long time so she forgot where the power cable was. I looked over the Mac and noticed that the touch pad had a crack and seemed to bulge. I thought that the bulge was probably related to the battery. My sister found the power cable so I took it home. 

Initial goal was to get it to power on. I connected the power cable and it turned on. Initial goal was met. I thought, “Maybe it only needed the cable and the battery is bad”. It turned out that the original hard drive was replaced a long time ago. The hard drive in there was a solid state drive that somehow became corrupted.

I then thought about opening the MacBook Pro and check if the battery really was behind the crack in the touch pad.

The suspicions I had would mean that the SSD and Battery would need to be replaced. I flipped the Macbook Pro and took off the back cover.

The tools that I have were purchased on Amazon for less than $30.

The three near the hinge are very long while the rest are very short. There is a low probability of losing the three long screws. Place them all in a safe place.

### The battery was definitely the reason why the touch pad was cracked. 

The battery was removed and the MacBook Pro did not have a bulge anymore.

The Y screw is tricky some times because many of the tool kits that I had, did not have it. Luckily, the less than $30 kit that I purchased from Amazon did have it.

The battery was not in good shape. It seemed to expand more after I took it out.

Since the battery was bad and the solid state drive was not functional. It was time to browse Amazon. I found a cheap ssd and a replacement battery. On the back cover the model number is listed in small letters. I typed in, A1278 Battery Replacement, and found a third party. I added to cart and then looked for reasonably priced a solid state drive. Found a Lexar NS100 256GB with many good reviews so I added to cart. I decided to only order the SSD. The SSD came in so the SSD that was in there was removed.

The reasoning behind Kali Linux is simple. I am leveling up my skills to become a Cybersecurity Analyst in a Security Operations Center. It had been recommended to me that Linux is vital to learn. I started the SOC Analyst learning path on Cybrary.org and they start with Kali Linux.

#### 3) Kali Installation

The installation process below was done on a virtual machine so that I could get the best screenshots.
Taking pictures of the laptop with the phone were not coming out well.
The installation is shown how a beginner could do the install initially.
The process could be redone when one is more familiar and the instal could be more customized.

### Once you put type in the username and password, you are now ready to put on a hoodie and begin using the tools included in Kali Linux.

### Remember to update and upgrade to keep up to date!

## In upcoming projects, I’ll document how I converted mini workstation(s) into servers to replace routers, add cameras, and self host services.
